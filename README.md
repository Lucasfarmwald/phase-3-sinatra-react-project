## Description
For my Phase 3 final project at Flatiron School I decided to create a blogging page. 
In this app users can create a user-id, create posts, edit posts and remove posts.

The application uses Ruby and Sinatra for the backend functionality, 
aswell as React for the front-end.

## Visual aid
[Check out this video on how to use the program](https://youtu.be/Pk9i1BMCNrk)

## Installation
To install the application, you will need to fork and clone this repository.
After you will need to use `bundle install` to install all gems.

## Usage
You can start your server with

`bundle exec rake server`

To run the frontend server first ensure you have run `npm install`
then run `npm start`.

## Roadmap
I don't have any specific things I want to accomplish with this program, however I am always open minded.
